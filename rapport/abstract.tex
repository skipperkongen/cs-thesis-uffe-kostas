In this thesis on robust optimization we show how partially robust
solutions to problems with uncertainty can be calculated using genetic
algorithms and scenario optimization. We define a solution with
partial robustness $\rho$ to be a solution that has a probability of
$\rho$ to be feasible given a realization of stochastic parameters in
an uncertain problem. We use simulation to prove the partial
robustness of solutions to uncertain problems, within statistically
precise bounds. We have successfully used our methods to solve the
knapsack problem with uncertainty and the capacitated lot-sizing
problem with uncertainty. For instances of the capacitated lot-sizing
problem with uncertainty, we are able to find robust solutions that
have an added cost of only $0.001\%$, when compared to the non-robust
optimal solution to the deterministic problem. For the knapsack
problem we are able to find partially robust solutions while losing
only $0.04\%$ of the profit of a non-robust optimal solution to a
deterministic problem.
