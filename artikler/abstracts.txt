  ---
  Stochastic:		No

- lsp_2_sa-ga-multilevel.pdf
  
  (Ir)relevance:	Not relevant because it's not LSP.

+ lsp_3_multilevel-heuristic.pdf

  (Ir)relevance:	Slightly relevant because it discusses a heuristic search algorithm for LSP, and has nice quotes.
  Problem:		Multi-level lot-sizing problem (MLLS)
  Keywords:		280 variants of stochastic search algorithm, Comparison with problem specific algorithms.
  ---
  Stochastic:		No
  Capacitated:		No ?

  Quote:		"The multi-level lot-sizing (MLLS) problem is a combinatorial optimization problem which can only be solved optimally within reasonable delays when small instances are considered."
  Quote:		"In particular, the MLLS problem has characteristic features that have permitted the development of specific methods: interdependencies exist among stages in the product structure."
  Quote:		"We find that these techniques (stochastic search alg.), despite their simplicity and the widespread belief that they are generally efficient, only seldom outperform problem-specific algorithms, and when they do so it is usually associated with a much longer execution time. We also exhibit an efficient combination of search and annealing which is found able to produce signi2cant and consistent improvements over problem-specific algorithms.

+ lsp_4_multilevel-dynamic-heuristic.pdf

  (Ir)relevance:	Slightly relevant because it's a heuristic for LSP, and maybe because dynamic = stochastic?
  Problem:		Single level multi-item capacitated dynamic lot sizing problem
  Keywords:		Heuristic
  ---
  Stochastic:		?
  Dynamic:		Yes, but what does it mean?
  Capacitated:		Yes
  Multi-level:		No
  Multi-item:		Yes
  Multi-resrc:		No ?
  Time-variant:		?

- robust_1_genetic-multipeak-conv.pdf
  
  (Ir)relevance:	Not relevant because by robust they mean robust convergence of algorithm, and it's not LSP.
  Problem:		Constrained multi-peak optimization problems
  Short description:	- 
  Keywords:		Genetic Algorithms, Niche forming, Multi-pass, Constraint penalty, Robustness, Multi-peak
  ---
  Stochastic:		No

++ robust_2_international-src.pdf

  (Ir)relevance:	Very relevant because: Description of algorithm for problem with uncertainty of 
                        parameters (future exchange rate/macroeconomic parameters). Robust solutions sought. Not LSP.
  Problem:		International sourcing (2)
  Short description:	Selection of suppliers in various countries to support the demands of the firm's international factory network
  Keywords:		Algorithm for N best robust solutions (i.e. sourcing networks) to the international sourcing problem
  ---
  Stochastic:		Yes
  Uses simulation:	?

++ robust_3_optimization-lin.pdf

  (Ir)relevance:	Very relevant because: Production scheduling with uncertainty in proc. times of tasks. Determination of golden zone. Finding robust solutions.
  Problem:		Production scheduling with uncertainty (objective function coefficients, LHS and RHS parameters).
  Short description:	By introducing a small number of auxiliary variables and constraints, a deterministic robust counterpart problem is formulated.
  Keywords:		Robust optimization methodology, bounded uncertainty, bounded and symmetric uncertainty.
  Quote:		Common sources of bounded uncertainty in scheduling problems: 
                        Processing times of tasks, market demands for products, and prices of products and raw materials
  ---
  Golden zone:		Yes, by introducing auxiliary variables and constraints to produce a deterministic counterpart problem.  
  Stochastic:		Yes

+ robust_4_scm.pdf

  (Ir)relevance:	Quite relevant because: Stochastic demand SCM, bit flimsy description of method in abstract though. 
  Problem:		Supply chain management with stochastic demand in discrete time.
  ---
  Stochastic:		Yes

+ robust_5_leastsquare.pdf

  (Ir)relevance:	Maybe relevant, if we understood it?
  Problem:		Least-squares problems with unknown (but bounded) coefficient matrices A and b
  Description:		(Convex) second-order cone programming, yielding an algorithm with complexity similar 
                        to one singular value decomposition of A. The method can be interpreted as a Tikhonov 
                        regularization procedure, with the advantage that it provides an exact bound on the 
                        robustness of solution and a rigorous way to compute the regularization parameter.

  Huh?:			Yes
